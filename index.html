        <h2 class="text-center display-5">What I Do</h2>
        <p class="lead">Chronic illness, whether it is physical or mental is a very difficult battle to fight. This
          battle can often
          seem invisible to your family or friends but is something you are dealing with every moment of every day for
          the foreseeable future. There are often a lot of issues that stem from chronic illness such as feelings of
          grief and loss, feelings of failure, perpetuating mental illness, feelings of isolation, and the list goes on
          and on.</p>
        <p>I am here to help guide you through your journey of learning to love yourself, heal from past trauma, improve
          relationships, or walk through the stages of grief.</p>
        <p>Clearer Skies got its name from one of my favorite quotes:</p>
        <p>“Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.”</p>
        <p>I love this quote because my goal as a coach isn’t to guide you to having rainbows and completely clear
          skies. It’s to in part recognize that bad days may come, but good days will too. Our goal is to have clearer
          days and improve your life. I feel that this is crucial when it comes to chronic illness. Chronic illness is a
          persistent struggle that doesn’t go away.</p>

        <p>A chronic illness is a long-term mental or physical illness. A chronic illness can last a year or more and
          may require long-term medical attention, counseling, and can inhibit quality of life</p>
        <p>Some examples of chronic illness may include:</p>
        <ul class="listcol-md-3">
          <li>diabetes</li>
          <li>arthiritis</li>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Growing up as a military kid, I had opportunity to live all over the world. Right now, I call North Carolina
          my home. I have a received a bachelor’s degree in social work then went on to be a care coordinator for
          Madison School district in Idaho, where I loved working with kids and teenagers struggling with anxiety,
          depression, life transitions, and self-esteem. I went on to obtain my master’s degree at Boise State
          University in Social Work and continued to grow by working as a Therapist in Logan Utah. I have loved being a
          therapist and helping people, and quickly became interested in working with people who have long-term medical
          conditions and/or have combatted mental illness for years. I have felt that this field, long-term illness,
          isn’t a high-trafficked area. I feel it should be because it effects millions of people, me included. Since
          chronic mental and physical illness is usually invisible, people often feel like they have to battle alone and
          without any tools. If you have been feeling this way, you have come to the right place. </p>
